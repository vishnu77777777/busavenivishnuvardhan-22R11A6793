Polynomial Constant Term Calculator
This Java program calculates the constant term of a polynomial based on its roots, which are provided in a JSON file. The program is designed to handle very large numbers using BigInteger and can parse root values from different numerical bases.
Code Description
PolynomialConstant.java reads a JSON file named input.json, extracts the polynomial's parameters and roots, and computes the constant term. It uses regular expressions for parsing the JSON data.
Key Features:
Large Number Support: Utilizes java.math.BigInteger to accurately calculate the constant term, even if it's an extremely large number.
Multi-Base Root Parsing: Can interpret root values written in different numerical bases (e.g., binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal).
File-Based Input: Reads the polynomial's properties from a structured input.json file.
Regex-Based Parsing: Employs Java's regex library to extract data from the JSON string. Note: For more complex applications, a dedicated JSON parsing library would be more robust.
The Logic Explained
The program is based on a fundamental property of polynomials. For a polynomial with roots r_1,r_2,…,r_d, it can be expressed in factored form as:
P(x)=a(x−r_1)(x−r_2)…(x−r_d)
Where 'a' is the leading coefficient (assumed to be 1 in this program) and 'd' is the degree of the polynomial.
The constant term of this polynomial is the value of P(0), which is found by substituting x=0:
P(0)=a(0−r_1)(0−r_2)…(0−r_d)
P(0)=a(−r_1)(−r_2)…(−r_d)
P(0)=a(−1)d(r_1⋅r_2⋅…⋅r_d)
The program implements this logic as follows:
Reads Input: The entire input.json file is read into a single string.
Determines Degree: It parses the value of k and calculates the polynomial's degree as degree = k - 1.
Calculates Product of Roots: It iterates from 1 to degree. In each step, it:
Finds the JSON object corresponding to that root's index (e.g., "1", "2").
Extracts the base and value for that root.
Converts the value string into a BigInteger using its specified base.
Multiplies this value into a running product, which starts at 1.
Applies Sign Adjustment: After multiplying all the roots, it checks if the degree is odd.
If the degree is odd, the (-1)^degree term is -1, so the final product is negated.
If the degree is even, the (-1)^degree term is 1, so the sign remains unchanged.
Prints Result: The final calculated BigInteger is printed to the console.
Input File Format (input.json)
The program requires a file named input.json to be in the same directory. This file must contain:
"n": An integer (its purpose is not used in the constant calculation but is expected in the file).
"k": An integer from which the degree (k-1) is derived. The program will find the first k-1 roots.
Root Objects: A series of JSON objects keyed by strings "1", "2", etc. Each object represents a root and contains:
"base": The numerical base of the root's value.
"value": A string representing the root's value in the given base.
Example input.json
{
  "n": 100,
  "k": 4,
  "1": {
    "base": 10,
    "value": "2"
  },
  "2": {
    "base": 16,
    "value": "A"
  },
  "3": {
    "base": 10,
    "value": "3"
  }
}


In this example:
k is 4, so the degree is 4 - 1 = 3.
The program will use the roots keyed "1", "2", and "3".
The roots are:
Root 1: 2 (base 10)
Root 2: A (base 16), which is 10 in decimal.
Root 3: 3 (base 10)
The calculation will be: (-1)^3 * (2 * 10 * 3) = -1 * 60 = -60.
How to Compile and Run
Prerequisites: Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Save the Files: Save the Java code as PolynomialConstant.java and create the input.json file in the same directory.
Compile: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory, and run the compilation command:
javac PolynomialConstant.java


Run: Execute the compiled code:
java PolynomialConstant


Output: The program will print the calculated constant term to the console.
Constant term = -60
